<h3><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">By:&nbsp;Saul Greenblatt</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mario Ober, a forty five-year-old bachelor, hung up his white lab coat, looked around his lab to make sure his important projects were in a state of suspension, input the directions to his unit, stepped on the transporter pad, pressed a button, and he was transported to his unit.. It was a two-room unit with kitchen facilities. In the living room there was a sofa, a chair, and an entertainment-communication monitor that measured six-feet by six-feet. Because of toxic air, there were no windows. However, a giant air purifier, that he invented, was housed in a twenty-five-story structure and worked constantly to bring clean air to the inhabitants of the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mario had everything a valued member of the community could want&hellip;everything except the love of a woman that, to him, was more important than all the material things that were given to him as tributes to his genius. He was lonely. &not;His friends and colleagues had arranged dates for him, but they were always a one-time meeting. He always tried to get a second date, but he was always refused. Mario had many first dates but never a second. Mario would come home from work, eat a synthefood dinner and watch television. It seemed to him that in all the shows he watched, there were a man and woman in love. At the end of a show, he turned off the television, sat on the couch, and felt very sorry for himself. &ldquo;Every man on television has a girlfriend,&rdquo; he said and stared at the blank screen. After thinking about the television shows, he closed his eyes, and wished as hard as he could for a woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Hi, Mario,&rdquo; a beautiful woman who appeared on the screen said. Mario jumped up and stared wide-eyed at the screen. &ldquo;Wha&hellip;what am I seeing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seeing me, Mario. My name is Kara. I&rsquo;m what you wished for&hellip;aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Well, you are a beautiful woman, and I don&rsquo;t know where you came from, but&hellip;yes, you are what I wished for. Where did you come from?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;I came from your brilliant mind. You created me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not real,&rdquo; he said sitting down. You&rsquo;re a figment of my imagination. I can only look at you. I can&rsquo;t touch you. I can&rsquo;t hold you in my arms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Yes, you can, Mario, just wish it,&rdquo; she said, he wished, and she appeared next to him on the couch.&rdquo; Mario was stunned and slowly reached out and touched the shoulder of the beautiful, naked woman sitting next to him. &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;m real.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re naked.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Yes, I come that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;If you want me to have clothes on, just wish it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;I think it would be better,&rdquo; he said and wished for her to have clothes on. Immediately, she was dressed. &ldquo;You look very nice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Thank you, Mario.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mario fidgeted. &ldquo;Well, uh, it&rsquo;s time for bed. Uh, I have a guest room if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Mario, don&rsquo;t you want me to sleep with you?&rdquo; she asked sounding disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Uh, yes, I do. I do,&rdquo; he said, and she took his hand and went into his bedroom. That night, Mario had what he dreamed about for many years; he had never been happier. In the morning, Mario got out of bed and looked at Kara. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this is happening to me. She&rsquo;s everything I&rsquo;ve always wanted. Hmm. My life would never be empty if I had two like Kara. Another beautiful woman, who will love me. They could keep each other company while I&rsquo;m at the lab. I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said, went to the living room, stood in front of the screen, and wished for a beautiful woman. Immediately, a beautiful woman appeared on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Hello, Mario, I&rsquo;m Dira. Do you want to hold me?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, made the wish, and the naked woman appeared in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re naked.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Yes. I come that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dress you, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said, wished, and she was dressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Do you want me to go to bed with you, Mario?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Uh, yes, but I have to go to work right now, but I&rsquo;ll be home in a few hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;Okay, Mario, I&rsquo;ll be waiting,&rdquo; she said, and he went to the transporter pad, that was by the front door, punched in a code that was on a pad on the door, and he disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At the end of the day, Mario transported home. When he appeared, he was greeted by three policemen. &ldquo;Wh&hellip;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&ldquo;We responded to a report that there was a fight, a loud fight and screaming coming from your unit,&rdquo; Officer one said. &ldquo;We found your two women on your bed. There was blood everywhere, and we found two carving knives&hellip;one in each victim&rsquo;s hand. It looks like they fought and killed each other. We&rsquo;re very sorry for your loss.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The moral:</strong> (From the Bible) &ldquo;Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man&rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.&rdquo;</span></p>
